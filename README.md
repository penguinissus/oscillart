name: Wiggly Thing or Sounds  
art with math  
made for Athena Awards

# Languages

# How to use
Input note letters in all caps, click submit your notes.  
Range of 7 notes: CDEFGAB  
Customize the colour of the waves and volume of sound output.  
Recording function will record the waves and download a video onto your computer.  

# Slight problem
The sound is supposed to stop after input notes have finished played, but it doesn't.  
Yes I have asked for help from friends, yes I have asked chatgpt, yes I have asked the person that create the oscillart guide and our code was the exact same, but there are still some uniquely weird problems. However, if you have any ideas of what I can try to fix this problem, please tell me, I'd love to get it fixed.
